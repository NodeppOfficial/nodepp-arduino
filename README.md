# Nodepp-Arduino

**Nodepp** is an innovative open source project that aims to make it easier to create applications in **C++**. This project introduces a high-level abstraction layer that allows developers to write **C++** code in a way that is similar to how they would write code in **NodeJS**. With **Nodepp**, developers can leverage the advantages of the **C++** language while benefiting from the ease of use and flexibility that **NodeJS** offers. This unique combination of features makes **Nodepp** a powerful tool for creating high-performance and scalable applications. Additionally, since it is an open source project, anyone can contribute and improve **Nodepp** to fit their specific needs.

## Features

- Open source project, meaning anyone can contribute and improve it
- Allows writing **C++** code as if writing in **NodeJS** or **Javascript**
- Adds a high-level abstraction layer to simplify **C++** application development
- Includes an **Event Loop** that can handle multiple events and tasks on a single thread
- Supports **Coroutines**, which allows running multiple tasks concurrently on a single thread

## Hello world
```cpp
#include <nodepp.h>

using namespace nodepp;

void onMain() {
    console::log("Hello World!");
}
```
